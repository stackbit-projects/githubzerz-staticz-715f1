establishing deep communication and creating\npleasure.\_Most traditional marketing methods have lost their effectiveness\nand do not motivate modern customers enough.\n\nThat is why introverted marketing\nhas become more and more popular in recent years than it was yesterday, and it\nis trying to solve the problems of traditional methods well by providing\nup-to-date solutions.\n\n\n\nThe idea of ​​introverted marketing\nis to sell something without \"selling\"!\_In fact, your customers\nwill buy your product because of their needs.\_The importance of this issue\nbecomes clear when you know that in today's world, people are no longer looking\nto buy a product!\_Rather, our goal in purchasing any product is to gain a\nnew \"experience\".\n\nIn introverted marketing, we provide\nonly the information our audience needs, and this helps our brand grow and our\nbusiness to be recognized as a thoughtful leader in the minds of the audience.\n\nWhat\nAre The Differences Between Introverted And Extroverted Marketing?\n\n[Introverted\nmarketing](http://ec2-3-90-209-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com/what-are-the-benefits-of-inbound-marketing/) is completely customer oriented.\_In this way, all the\ninformation that consumers need to make the right decision is made available to\nthem.\_In traditional or extrovert marketing, the focus is on \"what\nyour business is selling\".\n\nBut in\_extrovert marketing, it\nis about \"what your business identity is and why it sells such a product\nor service.\"\n\nIn fact, traditional marketing,\nunlike introverted marketing, is sales-oriented.\_Instead of focusing on\nthe customer's needs and talking about his needs, he explains the features of\nhis product.\n\nThis fundamental difference has made\ntraditional marketing much more expensive.\_In introverted marketing,\nrelying on creativity, effort and continuity and publishing content that offers\ngood value to people, organic customer attraction is done at a lower cost.\n\nFlywheel\nin Inbound Marketing\n\nIn inbound marketing, instead of\nusing a sales funnel, a flywheel is used.\_In this way, customers and\naudiences will not interact with your business just once.\_Because they enter\nthe circle and become loyal customers.\_These loyal customers will somehow\nact as your company's new marketers and bring more people into the\ncircle.\_The faster the wheel spins, the faster your business will grow.\nThe wheel consists of three parts: attraction, interaction and pleasure\n\nAttraction\nstrategy\n\nThis step depends a lot on the\nproduction and distribution of effective content.\_The attraction stage can\nalso be defined as the audience access stage.\_To do this, you need to\ngenerate content distributions such as blog posts and social media\nposts.\_Note that this content must provide \"value\" to the\naudience.\_For example, you need to show how your product solves a specific\nproblem for your audience.\_If you want to be more effective at this stage\n(in the digital world), it is better to consider a\_suitable\_content\nmarketing\_strategy\_and SEO for your content.\n\nInteraction\nStrategy\n\nThe engagement phase is when you\nneed to build a lasting, long-term relationship with your audience.\_In\nother words, you need to interact with your audience in such a way that they\nthemselves seek to maintain and continue to communicate with\nyou.\_Therefore, it is good to show them the value that your business can\ngive to the audience.\_To have a successful engagement strategy, ‌ Focus on\ncustomer service and sales.\_Listen to customers' problems and make sure\nyou always sell the solution to the problem instead of selling it.\n\nPleasure\nStrategy\n\nThe pleasure phase ensures that\ncustomers will remain happy and satisfied for a long time after purchasing from\nyour business.\_At this stage, you and your team members should become\nconsultants who are ready to help and guide clients at any time.\_The\npleasure phase, which is a kind of customer support phase, can take about six\nmonths.\_At this stage you should record the customer experience in using\nthe product / service, get feedback from them and try to solve their\nproblems.\_The use of chatbots and social networks is recommended for this\nstep.\n\nWhat\nIs the Difference Between Introverted Marketing and Content Marketing?\n\n[Inbound\nmarketing and content marketing](https://targetedwebtraffic.medium.com/what-are-the-benefits-of-inbound-marketing-8a8d552cde84) both rely on content production,\nappropriate distribution and distribution, and ultimately its effectiveness on\nthe audience.\_Both methods try to get the right and needed content to the\naudience instead of besieging them with lots of ads and useless\ncontent.\_However, inbound marketing and content marketing cannot be\nconsidered synonymous.\n\nContent marketing is a subset of\ninbound marketing.\_Because Inbound does not only use content to help\ncustomers;\_Rather, they are a collection of works that form an inbound\nmarketing.\_However, content marketing serves as the lifeblood of inbound\nmarketing.\_An artery without which inbound marketing no longer makes\nsense.\n\nWhat is the difference between\nintroverted marketing and digital and internet marketing?\n\nAbduction marketing is born at the\nheart of digital and internet marketing.\_However, you should not assume\nthat inbound marketing methods are limited to the digital world.\_Inbound\nmarketing is a philosophy that can be used in all aspects of\nmarketing.\_For example, if you want to inform your services by printing\nand distributing brochures, you can do so both inbound and outbound.\n\nWhen you randomly distribute a\nbrochure or tract on the street to everyone, you are actually doing extroverted\nmarketing;\_But when you distribute the brochure in a place related to your\nservices (for example, distributing the brochure of the front care center in a\nclinic), your method will be closer to introverted marketing.\n\n## Principles Of Inbound Marketing\n\n1-\nThe audience\n\nHaving information from your\naudience is your first and most important principle and tool in introverted\nmarketing.\n\nBut\nwho is the audience?\n\nEveryone your company / business\ninteracts with, including blog readers, social media followers, customers,\npartners and even company employees, is an audience.\_In inbound marketing,\nthe audience list is not limited to just a few names and their contact\ninformation;\_Rather, each name represents an individual who is individually\nvaluable and with whom you must have a lasting relationship.\_Remember that\nin introverted marketing, everything revolves around the customer.\n\nA complete list of audiences lets\nyou know who you are serving, thus identifying the needs of each person (or\ngroup of people) individually.\_Of course, keep in mind that having a\ncontact list does not mean that you have a lot of confusing information, and\nyou have to separate and record useful information from them.\_For example,\nif you are a shampoo company, it would be very helpful to categorize your\naudience by gender.\_Because this way you can email information about men's\nand women's shampoos separately for each person.\_But if you work in\nanother field such as education, another category such as age and level of education\nmay come in handy instead of gender.\n\n2-\_Customer\_persona\n\nIn addition to knowing who you are\nin a relationship with, you need to know who you want to be in a relationship\nwith.\_For example, you want to increase your website traffic, but you will\nnot need a lot of irrelevant visitors!\_Instead, you need people who are\nright and relevant to your work to come to the website and read your\ncontent.\_Those who will be your first leads and eventually your satisfied\ncustomers.\n\nThese right people form the customer\npersona: The customer persona is the semi-imaginary character or characters\nthat represent your ideal customers, and you build them based on real\ninformation and your own assumptions.\_Some of the persona information is\nobtained by researching and analyzing the information of those who are\ncurrently your customers.\_This concept in inbound marketing helps you to\nput yourself in the audience's shoes, assess their needs and produce content for\nthem in the same way.\n\n3-\nCustomer travel\n\nCustomer travel is a process that we\nhave all experienced as customers of different brands.\_This concept\nactually represents the process by which the person is attracted to your\nbusiness and ultimately makes the purchase.\_The customer journey consists\nof three main stages. 1- Awareness stage:\_It is the time when a person\nbecomes aware of his problem and seeks a solution for it.\n\n2- Consideration stage:\_In this\nstage, the person reaches several solutions and service providers to solve his\nproblem.\n\n3- Decision making: The\_stage\nin which a person chooses one of the solutions and service / product providers\nto solve his problem.\n\nYour customers may reach your\nwebsite in any of these three steps.\_Your job is to prepare the right content\nfor each stage.\n\n4-\nContent\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a successful\ninbound marketing strategy requires appropriate content.\_In other words,\ninbound marketing is the right content + the right context for that\ncontent.\_Blog posts, videos, webinars, podcasts, social media posts, گی are all content that your audience will\nreach at every stage of inbound marketing.\_Content production field is\nactually the people for whom you produce content, and you have to choose the\nright content for them.\_For example, someone who has been buying your\ncustomer's shoes will probably find the marketing talk irrelevant to your\nwebsite.\n\n5-\nDetermining the goal\n\nHas my inbound marketing strategy\nbeen successful?\_What should I optimize for the next marketing\nperiod?\_How did my audience sign up for a webinar?\_Has my website\ntraffic growth been good?\n\nIf you do not know what your goal of\nintroverted marketing is, you will never be able to answer these questions\nproperly.\_Goal setting is one of the most important principles of\nintroverted marketing and without it your strategy and all your efforts will be\nmeaningless.\_You need to set different time periods with specific goals\nfor yourself, and at the end of each period, measure your success in different\nways.\_SEO rank, the performance of landing pages in attracting the\naudience, the click-through rate of emails, the amount of interaction on social\nnetworks, and. Each are one of these methods.\_But you should be careful\nnot to limit yourself to just one method.\_For example, reaching 1000 comments\non Instagram is good, but it is not a sign of success.\_It is true that\nyour post has been viewed at least 1000 times, but are all the 1000 people who\nleft comments for you customers?\n\nLearn\nMore About Introverted Marketing Methods\n\nIntroverted marketing
